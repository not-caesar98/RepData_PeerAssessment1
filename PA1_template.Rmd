library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

##1. Loading and Preprocessing the Data
```{r}
# Read the CSV file included in the repository
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
#Convert date column to Date type
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date)
# Inspect structure
str(activity)
summary(activity)
```

##2. Mean number of steps taken per day
```{r}
# i. Number of steps
daily_steps <- activity %>%
        filter(!is.na(steps)) %>%
        group_by(date) %>%
        summarise(total_steps = sum(steps))
# ii. Histogram of no. of steps/ day
ggplot(daily_steps, aes(x = total_steps)) +
        geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000, boundary = 0) +
        labs(x = "Total Steps per Day", y = "Frequency",
             title = "Histogram of Total Steps per Day")

# iii. Mean & median of total no. of steps/day
mean_steps <- mean(daily_steps$total_steps)
median_steps <- median(daily_steps$total_steps)
mean_steps; median_steps

```

##3.Average daily activity pattern
```{r} 
# Compute mean steps per interval across all days
interval_pattern <- activity %>%
        filter(!is.na(steps)) %>%
        group_by(interval) %>%
        summarise(avg_steps = mean(steps))

# Time series plot
ggplot(interval_pattern, aes(x = interval, y = avg_steps)) +
        geom_line() +
        labs(x = "5-minute Interval", y = "Average Number of Steps",
             title = "Average Daily Activity Pattern")

#Identify interval with max average steps
max_interval <- interval_pattern %>%
        filter(avg_steps == max(avg_steps)) %>%
        pull(interval)
max_interval
```

##4. Imputing missing values

```{r}
#Total number of missing values in steps
total_missing <- sum(is.na(activity$steps))
total_missing
```
Strategy for imputing missing values: Replace each missing steps with the mean for that 5-minute interval.
```{r}
# Create function to impute
activity_imputed <- activity %>%
        group_by(interval) %>%
        mutate(steps = ifelse(is.na(steps), round(mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE)), steps)) %>%
        ungroup()

# Verify no NAs remain
sum(is.na(activity_imputed$steps))

# Recalculate total steps per day with imputed data
daily_imputed <- activity_imputed %>%
        group_by(date) %>%
        summarise(total_steps = sum(steps))

# Histogram
ggplot(daily_imputed, aes(x = total_steps)) +
        geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000, boundary = 0) +
        labs(x = "Total Steps per Day", y = "Frequency",
             title = "Histogram of Total Steps per Day (Imputed Data)")

# Mean and median with imputed data
mean_imputed <- mean(daily_imputed$total_steps)
median_imputed <- median(daily_imputed$total_steps)
mean_imputed; median_imputed
```

Differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends
```{r}
# Add weekday/weekend factor
activity_imputed <- activity_imputed %>%
        mutate(
                weekday = weekdays(date),
                day_type = ifelse(weekday %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "weekend", "weekday")
        )

# Compute average by interval and day_type
pattern_daytype <- activity_imputed %>%
        group_by(day_type, interval) %>%
        summarise(avg_steps = mean(steps)) %>%
        ungroup()

# Panel plot
ggplot(pattern_daytype, aes(x = interval, y = avg_steps)) +
        geom_line() +
        facet_wrap(~ day_type, ncol = 1) +
        labs(x = "5-minute Interval", y = "Average Number of Steps",
             title = "Average Steps by Interval: Weekday vs. Weekend")
```
